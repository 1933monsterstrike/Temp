Check the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient\SpecialPollInterval

This value is the interval in seconds. However, according to the Windows time Service blog, unless you manually set the SpecialPollInterval it will use a "dynamic interval that is determined by synchronization algorithms built into Windows Time Service".

Your article also specifies this and says that by default SpecialPollInterval is set to 604800 for workgroup computers, and 3600 for domain computers. So once a week for workgroup, and once an hour for domain computers.

As far as checking last sync time, check the event log for source Windows Time events, or you can use command "w32tm /query /status" and view "Last successful Sync Time"
